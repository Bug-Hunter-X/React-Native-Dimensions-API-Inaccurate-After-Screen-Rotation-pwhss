This bug occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The issue arises when the app is run on a device with a different screen orientation (e.g., rotating from portrait to landscape). The dimensions returned by `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` might not immediately reflect the changed orientation, leading to layout issues and incorrect rendering until the next layout update.
